# PortFolio
My portfolio
Hi there,

There is my PortFolio and first project.

I have build my own server on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Docker,
Docker-compose, Traefik (and certainly 
others i forgot). I haven't static ip for now 
then it may be that the redirection to my server jumps from time to time until I have resolved the problem.

I decide to learn TypeScript and ThreeJS to create this project.

My stack:

Front:
-TypesSript
-React
-ThreeJS
-Three React Fiber
-Three React Drei
-Axios
-SCSS

Back:
-NodeJS
-ExpressJS
-TypeScript
-TypeORM
-PostgreSQL
